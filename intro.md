We are three (so far) college students from Boston who all happen to have a month of free time this summer and we want to do something cool with it.  As such, w have decided to take to the road and do things we wouldnt be able to do otherwise.

As you can see from our other files in this repo, we are very interested in hackdom, maker culture, adventures, and exploring.  As CS majors/graduates, we hold a shared interest in tech culture, and hope to do a lot with it during this trip.  That said, we are also looking for "normal person" things as well, if you will.  This means we want to see landmarks, museums, monuments, natural wonders, etc.

We only get one shot at this, so we figured it would be best to seek the collective wisdom and knowledge of denizens of the internet to help us determine where and how to best use our resources to get the most out of this trip.  By using this repo, we hope to accomplish this in the most easily accessible, public, and most visible way possible, and we would like to thank @xzyfer for the fantastic idea!

If you would like to help, we are seeking ideas of things to do, places to visit, tips on road tripping, couches to crash on, and people to meet.  If you have a group or club or space you would like to share with us, that would also be super cool.  Please feel free to submit issues or pull requests as a method of contribution.

Thanks for reading,
Zack, Ali, and Andrew
