Hacking Across America
======================

So, we've got a month to throw at driving around, meeting hackers, and doing awesome things.

## General Themey Things

* Hackdom
* Outdoorsiness
* Musicality
* Creativity


## Important Advice
* "Avoid major highways whenever possible.  Interstates are fast, but they also provide absolutely ZERO in the way of character."
* "Take Route 66"
* "Stop in lots of small towns"
* "See a cool billboard?  Stop for it."


## Rules of the Road/Car
* No open alcohol in the car.
* No drugs in the car.
* We should set a maximum speed limit relative to the posted limit at which point we will all split speeding tickets.  10 or 15 over or whatever.
* Everyone needs their own credit card.  You're not putting your thousand dollars in emergency charges on my card - I don't care how much you're worth.
* Whatever car we bring will get a full checkup/oil change before we take off.  Any problems the car experience on the road we will split the cost of.


## Misc Stuff Around the Country
* Hacker Spaces! http://hackerspaces.org/wiki/United_States_of_America
* Roller Derby

## Lodgings
* http://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing
* https://www.couchsurfing.org/
* We have a "probably" on a place to stay in Portland, OR.
* We have a potential family connection to a place to stay in Silicon Valley.

## Stuff We Need (Group)
* 4g hotspot (Zack is going to look into getting a business deal on this)
* CB Radio.  Trucker chatter!
* A nice camera (high quality stills/video)
* Tent?
* GPS (Zack has a car one - better than using a phone)
* An emergency supply of non-perishable food
* Walky Talkys (useful when we aren't covered by mobile networks)
* Low-tech paper map/atlas
* Invest in a National Park Pass ($80/car/year)
    * http://www.nps.gov/findapark/passes.htm (page is currently down)
* STORAGE!  Either a roof rack or a tow behind.  If we get a tow behind the car needs a hookup.

## Stuff We Need (Individual)
* Clothing for any and all weathers

## Things to do on the trip:
* Learn an instrument
    * Zack plans on learning the harmonica. Harmonica and Python and Web Dev.
    * Ali's going to bring his guitar
* Journal it all
