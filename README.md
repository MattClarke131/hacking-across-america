Hacking Across America
======================

So, we've got a month to throw at driving around, meeting hackers, and doing awesome things.

## General Themey Things

* Hackdom
* Outdoorsiness
* Musicality
* Creativity


## Important Advice
* "Avoid major highways whenever possible.  Interstates are fast, but they also provide absolutely ZERO in the way of character."
* "Take Route 66"
* "Stop in lots of small towns"
* "See a cool billboard?  Stop for it."


## Rules of the Road/Car
* No open alcohol in the car.
* No drugs in the car.
* We should set a maximum speed limit relative to the posted limit at which point we will all split speeding tickets.  10 or 15 over or whatever.
* Everyone needs their own credit card.  You're not putting your thousand dollars in emergency charges on my card - I don't care how much you're worth.
* Whatever car we bring will get a full checkup/oil change before we take off.  Any problems the car experience on the road we will split the cost of.

## Places to Hit Up

This is organized by location.  Top level is state (or country in the case of Canadian territories), followed by municipality (generally city), followed by specific destinations, and all alphabetical.  In some cases the city isn't relevant, and the immediate level after state is a destination (like for national parks).  Please keep this organized, as it is going to be the most relevant way to determine where we end up going and how we're getting there.  Thanks!
