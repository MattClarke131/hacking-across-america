Hacking Across America
======================
##### APRIL 28 - MAY 30

So, we've got a month to throw at driving around, meeting hackers, and doing awesome things.

## Who We Are
We are three (so far) college students from Boston who all happen to have a month of free time this summer
and we want to do something cool with it. As such, w have decided to take to the road and do things we wouldnt
be able to do otherwise.

As you can see from our other files in this repo, we are very interested in hackdom, maker culture, adventures,
and exploring. As CS majors/graduates, we hold a shared interest in tech culture, and hope to do a lot with it
during this trip. That said, we are also looking for "normal person" things as well, if you will. This means we
want to see landmarks, museums, monuments, natural wonders, etc.

We only get one shot at this, so we figured it would be best to seek the collective wisdom and knowledge of
denizens of the internet to help us determine where and how to best use our resources to get the most out of
this trip. By using this repo, we hope to accomplish this in the most easily accessible, public, and most visible
way possible, and we would like to thank [@xzyfer](https://github.com/xzyfer) for the fantastic idea!

If you would like to help, we are seeking ideas of things to do, places to visit, tips on road tripping,
couches to crash on, and people to meet. If you have a group or club or space you would like to share with us,
that would also be super cool. Please feel free to submit issues or pull requests as a method of contribution.

Thanks for reading!

Zack, Ali, and Andrew

## General Themey Things

* Hackdom
* Outdoorsiness
* Musicality
* Creativity


## Important Advice
* "Avoid major highways whenever possible.  Interstates are fast, but they also provide absolutely ZERO in the way of character."
* "Take Route 66"
* "Stop in lots of small towns"
* "See a cool billboard?  Stop for it."


## Rules of the Road/Car
* No open alcohol in the car.
* No drugs in the car.
* We should set a maximum speed limit relative to the posted limit at which point we will all split speeding tickets.  10 or 15 over or whatever.
* Everyone needs their own credit card.  You're not putting your thousand dollars in emergency charges on my card - I don't care how much you're worth.
* Whatever car we bring will get a full checkup/oil change before we take off.  Any problems the car experience on the road we will split the cost of.


## Misc Stuff Around the Country
* Hacker Spaces! http://hackerspaces.org/wiki/United_States_of_America
* Roller Derby

## Lodgings
* http://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing
* https://www.couchsurfing.org/
* We have a "probably" on a place to stay in Portland, OR.
* We have a potential family connection to a place to stay in Silicon Valley.

## Stuff We Need (Group)
* 4g hotspot (Zack is going to look into getting a business deal on this)
* CB Radio.  Trucker chatter!
* A nice camera (high quality stills/video)
* Tent?
* GPS (Zack has a car one - better than using a phone)
* An emergency supply of non-perishable food
* Walky Talkys (useful when we aren't covered by mobile networks)
* Low-tech paper map/atlas
* Invest in a National Park Pass ($80/car/year)
    * http://www.nps.gov/findapark/passes.htm (page is currently down)
* STORAGE!  Either a roof rack or a tow behind.  If we get a tow behind the car needs a hookup.

## Stuff We Need (Individual)
* Clothing for any and all weathers

## Things to do on the trip:
* Learn an instrument
    * Zack plans on learning the harmonica. Harmonica and Python and Web Dev.
    * Ali's going to bring his guitar
* Journal it all
